## [Unreleased]

*No unreleased changes at this time.*

## [v0.3.6] - 2025-07-23 üçé macOS Developer Experience Enhancement

### Changed
- **Improved macOS installation UX**: Updated README to promote automated bootstrap script (`./bootstrap-macos.sh`) as "Quick Start" option, with manual installation as alternative
- **Enhanced developer onboarding**: macOS users can now get started with just 3 commands instead of navigating through detailed setup documentation

## [v0.3.5] - 2025-07-23 üîß Developer Experience & Testing Improvements

### Added
- **Version information in doctor health**: `doctor health` command now displays version number for better diagnostics
- **Improved make test**: `make test` now uses the reliable `doctor selftest` system (48/48 tests passing)
- **Professional onboarding workflow**: New contributors can now `make setup && make test` immediately after cloning

### Changed
- **Enhanced doctor health output**: Now shows `Version: vultitool 0.3.5` alongside timestamp and health checks
- **Fixed make test reliability**: Replaced broken pytest integration with working selftest system
- **Improved Makefile test target**: `make test` now auto-builds and runs comprehensive tests

### Fixed
- **Test system reliability**: Resolved pytest discovery issues by leveraging existing selftest infrastructure
- **Developer onboarding**: Fixed `make test` to work immediately after fresh clone and setup

### Documentation
- **Added proper attribution**: README now credits `testGG20` and `testDKLS` files from [SxMShaDoW/Vultisig-Share-Decoder](https://github.com/SxMShaDoW/Vultisig-Share-Decoder)
- **Enhanced professional standards**: Improved project setup documentation and workflows

### Technical
- **Build system improvements**: `make test` now has proper dependency resolution (depends on `build`)
- **Quality assurance**: Full clean-build-test cycle now works reliably from fresh environment
- **Version consistency**: All version displays now pull from single VERSION file source

## [v0.3.4] - 2025-07-22 üèõÔ∏è Canonical Vultisig Integration

### Added
- **Official Vultisig protobuf integration**: Now uses `github.com/vultisig/commondata` directly via Go modules
- **Version alignment**: Matches exact dependency versions from `vultisig-go` for maximum compatibility
- **Canonical source guarantee**: All protobuf definitions sourced from official Vultisig repositories (no local copies)
- **Go module integration**: Added proper Go workspace with official Vultisig dependencies

### Changed  
- **Eliminated local protobuf files**: Replaced with direct imports from `github.com/vultisig/commondata`
- **Updated go.mod**: Now includes official Vultisig commondata and protobuf dependencies
- **Enhanced Makefile**: Improved protobuf generation with official source validation
- **Updated documentation**: README now emphasizes canonical source integration and compatibility

### Technical
- **Dependencies aligned**:
  - `github.com/vultisig/commondata v0.0.0-20250710214228-61d9ed8f7778` (official protobuf schemas)
  - `google.golang.org/protobuf v1.34.2` (compatible with commondata)
  - `go 1.24` (matching vultisig-go requirements)
- **Build reliability**: Go binary builds successfully with official protobuf access
- **Unified architecture**: Single `vultitool` binary (removed obsolete `vultitool-go`)

### Documentation
- **README enhanced**: Added "Official Vultisig Integration" section highlighting canonical sources
- **Technical accuracy**: All documentation now reflects official integration approach
- **Developer confidence**: Clear guarantee of 100% compatibility with official Vultisig applications
