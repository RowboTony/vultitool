## Project Title

**Vultisig CLI & Ecosystem Test Suite (Codename: `vultitool`)**

---

## Project Vision & Purpose

> *Become the definitive source of technical truth for Vultisig‚Äîstarting with a foundational CLI tool and comprehensive ecosystem analysis. Enable better documentation, developer onboarding, and automated testing for the next phase of Vultisig‚Äôs growth.*

- **Primary goal:** Understand Vultisig at the deepest level (‚ÄúO‚ÄôReilly book‚Äù depth) to enable better contribution, documentation, and tooling.
- **Secondary goal:** Build a cross-platform CLI (`vultitool`) as the reference implementation for Vultisig vault, transaction, and swap functions.
- **Long-term:** Establish a knowledge base for both humans and AI, and lay the foundation for an automated, test-driven Vultisig ecosystem.

---

## Background

- Vultisig is a novel, seedless crypto wallet leveraging MPC TSS (GG20/DKLS, ECDSA/EdDSA) for transaction signing.  
- Core innovation: No seed phrases‚Äîvault "parts" (`.vult` files) instead.
- Supports hot (2-of-2) and secure (2-of-3) vaults.
- Primary codebase split: iOS, Windows, Android, Web (browser extension).
- Swapping powered by ThorChain, LiFi, and more.

**Official Vultisig Resources:**

## Project Goals & Deliverables

1. **Authoritative Understanding**
   - Write the ‚Äúdefinitive technical book‚Äù on Vultisig‚Äôs architecture, protocols, and usage.
   - Gather and synthesize all public Vultisig information (docs, code, Discord, blogs).

2. **Ecosystem Reverse Engineering**
   - Analyze Vultisig's main repositories, with special focus on the core infrastructure:
     - [commondata](https://github.com/vultisig/commondata) - Protocol buffer definitions and shared data structures
     - [mobile-tss-lib](https://github.com/vultisig/mobile-tss-lib) - Core TSS/MPC cryptographic operations for mobile platforms
     - [vultisig-go](https://github.com/vultisig/vultisig-go) - Advanced DKLS-based vault management CLI and reference implementation
   - Document protocols, file formats (`.vult`), flows, and infrastructure (esp. Vultiserver).

3. **CLI Reference Implementation ("vultitool")**
   - **Hybrid Architecture**: Python CLI for tooling/analysis, Go backend for cryptographic operations
   - **Python Components**:
     - Primary CLI interface and user experience
     - Vault parsing, inspection, validation, and export
     - Test automation and diagnostics ("doctor" commands)
     - Human-readable output and reporting
   - **Go Components**:
     - Cryptographic operations (encryption/decryption, key derivation)
     - TSS library integration (using official mobile-tss-lib)
     - Transaction building and signing
     - Performance-critical operations
   - **Interoperability**:
     - Go library bindings accessible from Python
     - Cross-validation between implementations
     - Shared test fixtures and protocol buffers
   - Support at minimum:  
     - Vault creation/import/export (Python + Go)
     - .vult parsing and inspection (Python)
     - Password-protected vault decryption (Go crypto, Python interface)
     - Transaction signing simulation (Go)
     - Multi-signature vault coordination (Go)
     - Basic swap (simulated, then real if possible)  
   - Output: Production-ready CLI with secure crypto backend

4. **Test & Audit Suite**
   - Use the CLI as a baseline for test automation (unit/integration/CI).
   - Compare against UI/UX flows for parity and bug reproduction.

5. **Vultiserver Deep Dive**
   - Understand Vultiserver‚Äôs signing, backup, and key management.
   - Document or run a local Vultiserver if feasible.
   - Security audit for potential vulnerabilities.

6. **Documentation Overhaul**
   - Refactor or create Vultisig developer docs with clarity, accuracy, and ‚Äúteachability‚Äù in mind.
   - Document both high-level concepts and low-level interfaces.

7. **Future: vultitool Dashboard**
   - Prototype a dashboard for Vultisig/Vultiserver system status (like ThorChain).
   - Potential: exploit/vulnerability scanner, SDK reference, and live test matrix.

## Constraints & Philosophy

- **Step-by-step:** Start simple (parse `.vult` ‚Üí sign ‚Üí swap), add features iteratively.
- **Transparency:** All findings, docs, and code to be public and open-source.
- **Teaching-first:** All tools, tests, and docs should be approachable for non-experts.
- **Cross-platform ideal:** Prioritize Unix/mac/WSL shell for MVP, but design with portability in mind.
- **Not a language expert:** Assume you (the project owner) are tech-proficient but need clear code explanations, language recommendations, and best-practice guidance.

---

## Key Open Questions & Research Tasks

1. **.vult File Spec:**
   - What is the minimum viable parser for both GG20 and DKLS formats?
   - Are there existing libraries or tools (see: mobile-tss-lib, SxMShaDoW‚Äôs decoder) that can be leveraged for this?

2. **Vault Creation & Signing Flow:**
   - Document (in code and words) the step-by-step keygen, vault join, and signing ceremony for both Fast and Secure Vaults.

3. **Swap Infrastructure:**
   - Which SDKs power swaps? (ThorChain, LiFi, others?)
   - Is there a common abstraction/interface across all app platforms?

4. **Vultiserver Details:**
   - What APIs, protocols, and key management approaches does it use?
   - Can it be run locally? Is it open source?

5. **Testing State:**
   - Are there *any* existing test suites or CI pipelines for Vultisig?  
   - If not, what‚Äôs the minimal set to bootstrap (using the new CLI as foundation)?

6. **Developer Experience:**
   - Is there a more unified way (Rust, Go, Node, Electron, Python) to build across iOS, Windows, Android, Web?
   - What are the tradeoffs for re-architecting Vultisig for better cross-platform parity?

7. **Emergency Recovery:**
   - What are the current best tools for reconstructing keys from `.vult` files for both GG20 and DKLS?
   - Can this process be reliably automated/tested via CLI?

## üÜï Vultisig-Go Integration & Documentation Initiative

### Context & Motivation

As of July 2025, it is clear that **`vultisig-go` is not used directly by the main Vultisig application repos**, but is instead a complementary, developer-focused CLI tool built on top of the same shared cryptographic foundation (`commondata` for protos, `mobile-tss-lib` for cryptography).

However, the official `vultisig-go` repository is missing essential developer onboarding materials:  
- No README, no setup documentation, and hard-to-discover dependencies (e.g., native libs, Nix).
- GG20 support is read-only; DKLS is now the primary focus.
- The tool assumes deep cryptographic and infrastructure knowledge.

### New Project Objective

**My goal is to create a developer-friendly fork of `vultisig-go` that:**
- Provides thorough documentation (setup, build, usage, limitations, and quickstart).
- Bridges the gap between Vultisig power-users and new contributors.
- Enables easy local onboarding for TSS/MPC development, research, and integration.

### Integration Plan

1. **Fork `vultisig-go` into my own repo (`RowboTony/vultisig-go`)**
   - All improvements are tracked and documented for transparency.
   - Explicitly state that this fork is for onboarding, research, and developer experience.

2. **Document Every Step**
   - Add a comprehensive `README.md` (what, why, how).
   - Step-by-step environment setup, troubleshooting, and real-world examples.
   - Limitations and gotchas (e.g., native library needs, DKLS vs GG20).

3. **Integrate with vultitool**
   - Add support so vultitool can optionally call vultisig-go for source-of-truth operations.
   - Shared fixtures: both tools use the same `.vult` test files for validation.

4. **Promote Best Practices**
   - Use temporary directories for vault files (no silent local persistence).
   - Document safe patterns for integration with other wallets and future SDKs.

### Why This Matters

- **Vultisig-go is very relevant for developers**: All protocol knowledge, live reference implementation, but hard to approach without a guide.
- **My fork will be the ‚ÄúO‚ÄôReilly Book‚Äù for Vultisig-Go**: Onboarding, dev experience, real documentation.
- **Synergy with vultitool**: Python for analysis, Go for protocol truth, both fully testable and auditable.

### Roadmap Additions

- [x] Fork `vultisig-go` and initialize documentation
- [ ] Document missing native dependencies and build steps
- [ ] Develop test harness for vultitool/vultisig-go parity
- [ ] Publish onboarding blog or tutorial for new devs

---

#### *All architectural discoveries and developer experience improvements will be documented in both `spec.md` and the project README to support future contributors, LLM training, and the wider Vultisig community.*
